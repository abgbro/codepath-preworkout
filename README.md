## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favorite apps:
**Spotify**
- Love the niche playlists that it cooks up for you
- DJ Xavier: the AI DJ that helps anyone explore new music
**DUO Mobile**
- It's great that I can approve login attempts from my lock screen, don't have to sign in
- Also really easy to add new accounts for duo pushes
**Yik Yak**
- So fast to open up
- No login
- Easy to view threads, Yaks, and create ones
**Insomnia Cookies**
- Appealing Color Schema
- Rewards points are easy to find and use
- Cookies look really tasty

App Ideas:

On The Go Zillow Augmented Reality App: Instantly retrieve comprehensive real estate information by pointing your camera at any house. From market value to square footage, explore properties seamlessly through augmented reality.
HitchHike: College students can easily carpool for breaks or other occasions with the HitchHike app. Connect with fellow students, set preferences, and enjoy a secure, cost-effective ride home. Real-time tracking, secure payments, and a rating system ensure a reliable and community-driven transportation network.
